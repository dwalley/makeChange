# Given a monetary amount calculates and lists (if you uncomment the print statements) the number of 
different ways change can be made for the amount using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.  There
are three different algorithms implemented: an elegant, recurrsive algorithm which is very inefficient;
a brute-force method which is not so bad; and an algorithm using the concept of memoization from
dynamic programming, which is faster than the brute force method.
